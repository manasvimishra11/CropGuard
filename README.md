# CropGuard
This repository contains code for a AI driven plant disease detection chatbot. This project mainly consists of three major phases which include: 
1. Building Machine Learning models for image classification
2. Integrating machine learning models and frontend of the chatbot, along with LangChain Integration
3. Deployment of the webapp

Dataset Used : PlantVillage Dataset

## Building Machine Learning Models for Image Classification 
In this we have built trained and tested three different models, one for each plant variety (tomato , bell pepper and potato). 
This model building process involved splitting the dataset into training and test data. Perfoming data augmentation on the dataset being used to improve the accuracy of the model. We have utilized a Convolutional Neural Network model which is specialised for working with images and image classifications

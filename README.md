# CropGuard
This repository contains code for a AI driven plant disease detection chatbot. This project mainly consists of three major phases which include: 
1. Building Machine Learning models for image classification
2. Integrating machine learning models and frontend of the chatbot, along with LangChain Integration
3. Deployment of the webapp

Dataset Used : PlantVillage Dataset

## Building Machine Learning Models for Image Classification 
In this we have built trained and tested three different models, one for each plant variety (tomato , bell pepper and potato). 
This model building process involved splitting the dataset into training and test data.

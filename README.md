This repository contains code for training and deploying machine learning models to classify plant diseases. There are two main parts in this project, one for classifying Pepper diseases and another for Potato diseases. The code also demonstrates how to split the dataset into training and validation sets, train deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras, and convert these models into TensorFlow Lite format for deployment.
